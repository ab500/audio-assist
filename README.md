audio-assist
============

A Visual Studio extension that adds awesome noises to debugging.

notes
=====

The project should build out of the box, if not please send me a message at andrew (dot) robinson (at) gmail (dot) com!

AudioAssist is released 100% for free, and serves as a good demonstration for hooking to Visual Studio
events. Feel free to take this code, modify, change, update, merge, or whatever with it. 

The installer is a little messy at the moment, I'd welcome a pull request from someone who has packaged
it up a bit nicer.

Thanks for checking this out!
